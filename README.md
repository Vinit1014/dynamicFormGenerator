## Features

- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Create and render forms dynamically based on user-defined configurations.
- **Form Validation**: Validate form inputs using Zod.
- **Custom Form Builder**: Build custom forms with different field types (text, textarea, dropdown, checkbox, radio, file).
- **Save/Load Form Configurations**: Save form configurations as JSON files and load them when needed.

## Installation

To get started with the application, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dynamic-form-generator
npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. You can access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing the Application

1. **Create a Form**: Use the Form Builder to create a form with various input types.
2. **Save/Load Form Config**: Save the created form configuration to a JSON file and load it back to see if the form is recreated correctly.
3. **Submit the Form**: Fill out the form and submit it to see validation in action. Check the console for validation errors and form submission data.
